![model_architecture](./model.pdf)

These are source code and experimental setup for the MASS SS3 database.

# Datasets

 We evaluate our model on the DEAP and the MAHNOB-HCI dataset. They are both open-access and common emotional databases. DEAP can be found [here](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) and MAHNOB-HCI can be found [here](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/).

# Requirements

- Pytorch 1.6.0
